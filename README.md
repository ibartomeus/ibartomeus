I am a researcher working at EBD-CSIC (Doñana Biological Station), Seville. 
I am a community ecologist broadly interested in understanding how global change drivers 
impact community structure and composition, and how those impacts translate to the ecosystem functioning.
I am increasingly interested in ecological theory and how to apply it to conservation problems. 
I like to work with plant-pollinator communities because they show complex responses to land use change,
climate warming or biological invasions, and encapsulate a critical ecosystem function, pollination.
